# Ecological participants
## vToken holders
PoS assets are cross-chained, no need to lock up to obtain Staking income, redeem the original assets and Staking income at any time, and participate in BNC mining and Boca parallel chain ecology.

## BNC vote
Use BNC to participate in block node, synchronization node, and Stake proxy node voting, and asset Stake to select cross-chain target nodes to provide decision-making, to obtain node voting rewards, and to bear the node offline or evil punishment.

## Verify node
The top 100 nodes with total votes are responsible for the bookkeeping processing and packaging of block-chain user transactions, and receive 10% of the user's voting income.

## Sync Node
The remaining nodes ranked behind in total votes are responsible for setting up synchronous nodes to receive transactions and broadcast data, and will receive the same revenue as the block-producing nodes.

## Stake proxy node
Satisfy the conditions of the node that generates the block, build nodes on multiple PoS target chains, and be responsible for accepting stake agents for escrow assets. It is a multi-chain professional node with strong comprehensive strength.

## vToken DEX
Provide liquidity to Staking assets, match Staking and UnStaking user transactions, Staking users earn UnStaking redemption users' discounted profits immediately.

## Cross-chain channels
Various types of mining pools, wallets and community developers help users to cross-chain assets without locking Staking, and channels can get user Staking profits.

## Development community
Developers can develop applications such as mining pools, Dapps, and DeFi based on the bottom layer of Bifrost, while satisfying the original business requirements, and gaining staking gains.
