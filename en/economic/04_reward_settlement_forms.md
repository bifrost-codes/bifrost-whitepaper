# Reward Settlement Forms

How to ensure the decentralized generation of the derivative rewards while making it more simple to provide liquidity, adding derivatives compatibility scenarios is the core question. Therefore, the reward settlement form of vToken is designed to be compatible with both centralized and decentralized scenarios. In centralized scenarios, vToken is available to be used or converted without extra development by a third party. For those users who host vToken in centralized hot wallet or cold wallet can still get the rewards generated by vToken without loss. This is due to the fact that vToken eliminates the traditional transaction settlement form on chain and adopts the vTokenmint Price Up method to complete the settlement of vToken rewards. Therefore, in order to avoid the later users' sharing of previous users' rewards, users entering from different periods will follow the current vTokenmint price.

Case A: User A mints 1000vDOT with 0.01 Token Mintprice that converted by 10 DOT in Bifrost. Original DOT through the Voucher Notary and Voucher Bidder game to complete Staking, which will generate 0.5 original DOT reward after one week. Note, the reward DOT generated by Staking does not correspond to the minting of new vDOT, the Mintprice is raised from 0.01 Token to 0.0105 Token (10.51000). At the moment, 1000 vDOT can redeem 10.5 DOT, the extra 0.5 DOT is the Staking reward from holding vDOT for one week.

Case B: According to Case A, the Mintprice has risen to 0.0105 Token. Now, user B can mint 952.380952381 vDOT (vToken accuracy is 1012) by 10 DOT with current mintprice of 0.0105 Token and he will receive 0.5 DOT reward after one week of Staking. Therefore, the original mintprice will raise from 0.0105 Token to 0.011025 Token (10.5952.380952381), which means that 952.380952381 vDOT can redeem 10.5 DOT now, the extra reward of 0.5 DOT is the Staking reward by user B holding vDOT for one week.
