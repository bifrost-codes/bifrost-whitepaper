# Staking Derivatives

Bifrost is a completely decentralized network, standardizing the interest generation, settlement and equity retention of Staking assets, which can provide liquidity for all kinds of Staking assets. However, due to the decentralized characteristics, the collateral also needs to have the following characteristics: 
* Assets released on chain
* Reward settled on chain
* Equity proved on chain

At present, PoS consensus assets naturally have the above three characteristics. Bifrost will provide liquidity for Staking assets as the entry point of the market, and provide liquidity of Staking derivative vToken for various PoS networks.
