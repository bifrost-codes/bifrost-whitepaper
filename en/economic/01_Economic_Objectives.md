# Economic Objectives

Providing liquidity for 80% of pledged assets is Birost's mission and vision. We believe that the road to realizing the vision begins with the design of the rules, and that Bifrost will provide services to users in the form of shared Polkadot security, and we believe that while providing staking liquidity to other PoS chains, other chains are indirectly transferring their consensus security to Bifrost. Independent PoS consensus is expensive to maintain, and when an independent main-net is running, if the total amount of assets locked in that network exceeds its market value, hackers will have enough incentive to attack the independent main-net and move the assets, which not only kills the project outright, but also causes a chain reaction of attacks on the security of the other networks it supports. So when running an independent main-net, the maximum amount of assets that can be locked in that network is its market value, so Bifrost will share the consensus security of Polkadot or Kusama instead of maintaining a separate set of PoS networks, making the assets locked in the Bifrost network more secure.

In summary, Bifrost will reserve a certain percentage of BNC as a cost to pay for parachain slots or threads, and as the number of slots increases, this cost will drop significantly compared to the cost of maintain a separate main-net, making it easier for Bifrost to capture the value generated by the network for its users. Also economic models such as vTokenmint and holding incentives, Collator incentives, Slash insurance funds, etc. all contribute to the sustainability of the Bifrost network.
