# vTokenmint Channel Funds

By using Bifrost vTokenmint protocol, users can ransfer coinage channel parameters, which will record contributions to the corresponding channel according to the value of the Tokenmint. In Bifrost Staking Reward Structure, 3% will be allocated as channel funds by all channels according to the proportion of their total contributions. When channel contribution is high, it will receive more share of the channel funds generated by users, which will encourage more developers to integrate the Bifrost vTokenmint protocol into Wallet, Dapp and Exchange. The channel contribution will continue to increase until the referendum proposal is passed every six months.
