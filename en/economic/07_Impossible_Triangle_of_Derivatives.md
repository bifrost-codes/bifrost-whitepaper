# Impossible Triangle of Derivatives

* Governance Vote Right of Original Chain
Token holders choose the Validator, just like in a representative democracy, the election of an MP. Each Token represents a vote, the vote right belongs to the Token holder. Staking derivatives as the interlayer should inherit the right for users to choose Validators on their own. However, this might be a serious problem that derivatives are non-fungible, which means that users who choose different Validators will get different derivatives.

* Fungible
Token holder selects any Validators to generate the same proceeds, implementing different Tokenmint derivatives by different holders have the same governance right. Fungible Staking derivatives have better liquidity, but Token holders might face Tragedy of Commons by eliminating the Slash risk for choosing Validators thus overall Staking reward will decrease.

* Right Expression
Staking derivatives can inherit the proceeds from Staking collateral while liberating the liquidity of Staking. When Staking derivatives are transferred, their proceeds and redeemed right will be transferred accordingly.

In Bifrost Impossible Triangle of Derivatives, In order to provide better liquidity of Staking derivatives, the protocol design focuses more on the two aspects of fungible and expression of rights. By default, usersâ€™ original chain voting rights are delegated to Bifrost protocol by means of vote price bidding. Meanwhile, users can still choose the particular bidder to delegate when they have special needs.
