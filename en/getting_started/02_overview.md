# Overview

Bifrost is a Polkadot parallel chain developed by Substrate that is perpendicular to the Staking ecosystem. The underlying layer is based on the WebAssembly, LIBP2P, and GRANDPA consensus, allowing users to complete Staking and obtain corresponding rights while assets cross-chain.

Bifrost uses the cross-chain method of the transfer bridge to access multiple PoS main chains. Through the cross-chain Stake assets, it has the advantages of no need to lock positions, automatic compound interest, and Stake agents. Mapping into the Bifrost parachain will get corresponding mapped assets (vEOS, vDOT, vATOM, etc.). Users only need to hold the mapped assets to get corresponding Stake income according to the holding amount.

Bifrost supports the asset mining model of One Asset One Vote. It measures mining weights based on the market value of EOS, DOT, ATOM and other assets mapped by users across the chain, and issues new coins using the model of gradually halving Bitcoin from zero. BNC issued by Fair Distribution System.

As a parallel chain of the Polkadot architecture, Bifrost provides Stake logic from the bottom. Applications such as DEX and DApp built on Bifrost will obtain native Stake gains. This method will greatly expand the Stake scenario. Users can directly recharge the map or DEX. When purchasing cross-chain assets, he passively participated in the ecological construction of Stake.
