# Runtime environment

> As an important part of the Bifrost chain, the runtime environment is more low-level than smart contracts. The runtime environment consists of various runtime modules. The runtime modules include modules such as accounts, balances, staking, smart contracts, transition bridges, governance, and consensus. Modules can be independent of each other, while allowing modules to call each other. Most of the code logic of the chain runs in the runtime environment.

The runtime environment allows each runtime module to be upgraded independently, while an important feature of it is that there is no hard fork upgrade. When the existing blockchain system is upgraded, due to the inconsistent running versions of each node, there is a risk of causing a hard fork of the entire chain, which seriously affects the healthy development of the entire ecosystem and the interests of nodes and users. Bifrost generates two versions each time the module is upgraded: Native and WASM. When the runtime environment determines that the version of the updated module is consistent with the current Native version, run the Native version code directly to get the fastest operating efficiency. When the version of the updated module is not consistent with the current Native version, the node directly runs the uploaded file without interrupting operation WASM version, complete no hard fork upgrade.
