# Initial Parallel Chain Offering (IPO)

Only projects that obtain the parachain slot can be called Polkadot parachain, which can realize shared security and relay cross-chain features. According to Polkadot IPO strategy, parachain slots will be released by stages with DOT Staking auction rank. Parachain slots contain 6 to 24 months lease time, and Bifrost plans to bid at least 4 years with 12% of total BNC for the auction of parachain slots. DOTs that perform Bifrost parachain slot lockups will get BNC as reward, while Bifrost will also leverage its business characteristics to provide users with the liquidity of a parachain lockup DOT (tentatively designated as pDOT). At present, there are uncertainties regarding the auction rules of Polkadot parachain, and the specific rules related to IPO participation will be announced after the introduction of the auction rules.
