# Implementation Plan

Bifrost will complete its business as a Polkadot parachain, sharing Polkadot consensus security with other parachains and avoid the high cost of operating and maintaining a separate network of public chains. The cost of operating a PoS public chain network is enormous; in Cosmos' case, it costs approximately 15,344,540 ATOMs (about $83,474,302) per year to maintain network security through inflation rate around 5.8% per year (according to 72% Staking rate and 8.09% yield rate currently) , and high inflation can even push the network into a death spiral if the network usage is low and value capture is inadequate.


On the other hand, Bifrost's current entry from the Staking derivative to provide liquidity to most PoS networks will inevitably result in the native assets and their corresponding votes in most PoS networks being reflected in the Bifrost protocol, with the consensus security corresponding to such native assets being transferred to the Bifrost network. If the cost of a Bifrost Consensus Security attack is lower than the cost of the original PoS Consensus Security, this will cause hackers to intentionally attack the Bifrost network to complete the attack on the original PoS network, which will result in the Bifrost network no longer being trusted, or even technically counteracted by other PoS networks. Therefore, the Bifrost protocol can provide Staking mobility for other PoS networks under objective conditions only if the Bifrost consensus security is higher or equal to the original PoS network.

Therefore, Bifrost will bid for the PoS parachain slot and share the PoS consensus security by becoming a parachain, which on the one hand gives more consensus security to other PoS networks and parachains supported by Bifrost, and on the other hand, reduces the high cost that Bifrost incurs for maintaining the consensus security of independent PoS networks.
