Bifrost is a cross-chain network that provides liquidity for Stake. The vision is to provide Stake liquidity for 80% of the PoS public chain. It is expected to help users cross-chain and provide Stake revenue while reducing the threshold for Stake users. Through decentralized Stake agents This method helps the major PoS public chains to increase the Stake ratio, making their ecology more decentralized and more secure.

Bifrost creates a Stake gain environment from the bottom layer, allowing various projects based on Bifrost's Dapp, Dex, DeFi and other projects to provide cross-chain capabilities. At the same time, the Stake gain attribute is added to make the ecology more competitive.
